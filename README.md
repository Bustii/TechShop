Hello,
This is my Project Defence.
This is my online store for computer hardware.
On the site you can browse products, shop, there is a shopping cart, and you can track all the orders you have made so far. When you log in as an admin, you have an admin panel where you can add new products, edit and delete. You can also add new categories, you can see all registered users and you can make each of them an Administrator. Also, any user can change their account details except for email.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow these steps to start the project.

1. Download the project, run it and change the connection string in appsettings.development.json.

2. In the package manager, on Default Project choose: Data\TechShop.Data (there is TechShopDBContext). After that type update-database so that the database can be written.

3. Start the project, then register with the following email: admin@techshop.bg. The second account can be made according to your choice.

4. Then log into the database and add a role to the admin@techshop.bg account to become an administrator and access the administrator panel.

5. Enjoy
